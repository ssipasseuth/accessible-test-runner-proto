            <p>Every day, millions of shoppers hit the stores in
                full force—both online and on foot—searching
                frantically for the perfect gift. Last year, Americans
                spent over $30 billion at retail stores in the month of
                December alone. Aside from purchasing holiday
                gifts, most people regularly buy presents for other
                occasions throughout the year, including weddings,
                birthdays, anniversaries, graduations, and baby
                showers. This frequent experience of gift-giving can
                engender ambivalent feelings in gift-givers. Many
                relish the opportunity to buy presents because
                gift-giving offers a powerful means to build stronger
                bonds with one’s closest peers. At the same time,
                many dread the thought of buying gifts; they worry
                that their purchases will disappoint rather than
                delight the intended recipients.
                Anthropologists describe gift-giving as a positive
                social process, serving various political, religious, and
                psychological functions. Economists, however, offer
                a less favorable view. According to Waldfogel (1993),
                gift-giving represents an objective waste of resources.
                People buy gifts that recipients would not choose to
                buy on their own, or at least not spend as much
                money to purchase (a phenomenon referred to as
                ‘‘the deadweight loss of Christmas”). To wit, givers
                are likely to spend $100 to purchase a gift that
                receivers would spend only $80 to buy themselves.
                This ‘‘deadweight loss” suggests that gift-givers are
                not very good at predicting what gifts others will
                appreciate. That in itself is not surprising to social
                psychologists. Research has found that people often
                struggle to take account of others’ perspectives—
                their insights are subject to egocentrism, social
                projection, and multiple attribution errors.</p>
